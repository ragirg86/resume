    <p>Hi, I am Ragi RG and I hail from Trivandrum. I live with my husband at Vazhayila. My hobbies include making diy crafts, recycling and painting...<br />
    <br>I have a B.tech in Information Technology and I have been in the IT industry for 11 years in different roles. I started my career as a Process executive in Xilligence in 2010
    after completing my B.Tech in IT. I was a part of the Data Operations team for a Canadian Digital marketing agency, DAC. The role consisted of
      <ul>
        <li>assure the quality of business data across various search engines,</li>
        <li>business listing management</li>
        <li>local presence and store locator management</li>
        <li>and competitive analysis for their clients</li>
      </ul>
    <br>In 2019, I got the opportunity to switch my career to the Quality assurance for the same client. Watching my onsite Product Managers managing the end-to-end lifecycle of
    the projects resonated with what I wanted to be a couple of years down the line and I resigned as a test engineer in last June. I want to work from start to end of a project,
    not just the QA side. I like to communicate and coordinate between different teams.
    </p>
